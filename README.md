# Pillpal PCB design

## Overview

This project presents a PCB design for a **Medicine Dispenser Machine** that is capable of dispensing medicines at predefined time slots. The dispenser is designed using **Altium Designer** and incorporates an **ESP32** chip for Wi-Fi connectivity, allowing it to interact with a mobile application.

## Features

- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: The PCB is equipped with an ESP32 chip, enabling wireless communication with a mobile app for remote control and monitoring.
- **Motor Drivers**: Supports two motor drivers, allowing for precise control of dispensing mechanisms.
- **LCD Display**: Connects to an LCD display for user interface, providing real-time information about the dispenser's status and scheduled releases.
- **Predefined Time Slots**: The dispenser can be programmed to release medications at specific intervals, enhancing medication adherence.

## Components Used

- **ESP32 Chip**: Main controller for processing and Wi-Fi communication.
- **Motor Drivers**: Two motor drivers for controlling the dispensing mechanism.
- **LCD Display**: Used for user interaction and status updates.
- **Active Components**: Various resistors, capacitors, and other active components as per the schematic design.
